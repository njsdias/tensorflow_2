This repository attends to acquire knowledge about the new version TensorFlow 2.0.

Here, we will Implement Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models:
- Introduction to TensorFLow 2.0
- Supervised LEarning with TensorFLow
- Neural Networls and Deep LEarning with TensorFlow
- Images with TensorFlow (under construction)
- Natural Language Processing
- TensorFlow Models in Production
